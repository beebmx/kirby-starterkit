# Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is to install it via [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/new/beebmx/kirby-starterkit) with the `Custom Starter Kit` interface or through the command line with laravel's installer:

```sh
laravel new project-name --using=beebmx/kirby-starterkit
```

You can also use the traditional way of cloning the repository and installing the dependencies manually. This is a good option if you want to customize the installation or if you are not using Herd.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:beebmx/kirby-starterkit.git
cd kirby-starterkit
cp .env.example .env
composer install
npm install
npm run production
```

**Kirby: the CMS that adapts to any project, loved by developers and editors alike.**
The Starterkit is a full-blown Kirby installation with a lot of example content, blueprints, templates and more.
It is ideal for new users to explore many of Kirby's options and get to know the Panel.
